It looks like there are 2 files that valhiem uses to load a world

`worldName.db` which is all of the buildings and game data

and
 
`worldName.fwl` which is the world seed info

mine are located in `~/AppData/LocalLow/IronGate/Valheim/worlds`

If we push those up to github whenever we play solo that might actually work?

## How to load this world

1. download the 2 valhiem files in this repo (`MMXGitTest.db` and `MMXGitTest.fwl`)
2. add them to your valhiem `/worlds` folder.
3. Profit?
